<p>The journey of migrants from their home countries to new destinations is often fraught with challenges and vulnerabilities that force them to leave.
     Nevertheless, adapting to a new culture and lifestyle can be equally difficult.
      Our goal is to provide you with insight into the experiences of migrants and help you understand their journey from &quot;home to hope.&quot;
       This interactive project offers you the opportunity to explore the journeys of former migrants and gain
        a deeper appreciation for their resilience and perseverance in the face of adversity. </p>

<p>The journey of migrants is a challenging one, 
    yet often unrecognized by the general population. 
    The journey is filled with hardships and dangers, 
    and migrants are often vulnerable to them. Even if they
     successfully complete their journeys and start a new life in a new place,
      migrants still face numerous hardships. From discrimination to mental 
      health issues and difficulties adapting to a new culture, language, 
      and professional system, the migrant experience is far from easy.
       Our hope is that our project has shed light on the vulnerabilities 
       and struggles of being a migrant, 
    and helped you empathize with their experiences.</p>
