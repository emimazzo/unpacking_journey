<h1> Unpacking the Journey</h1>

<p> The journey of migrants from their home countries to new destinations is often fraught with challenges and vulnerabilities that force them to leave.
     Nevertheless, adapting to a new culture and lifestyle can be equally difficult.
      Our goal is to provide you with insight into the experiences of migrants and help you understand their journey from "home to hope."
       This interactive project offers you the opportunity to explore the journeys of former migrants and gain
        a deeper appreciation for their resilience and perseverance in the face of adversity. </p>
